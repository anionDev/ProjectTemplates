# Design

The Material-design described and defined on [material.io](https://material.io) will be used as design but with the following semantical changes:

- Capslock-texts are not allowed. Instead of capslock the usual case-sensitivity must be applied.
- When something like a button is in a list then it must be ensured all list-elements (which also includes the last list-item) are fully visible.
