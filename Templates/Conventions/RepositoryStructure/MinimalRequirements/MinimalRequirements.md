# MinimalRequirements

## Purpose

`MinimalRequirements` is an attempt for a minimal standardized repository structure which are applicable for nearly all repositories. It contains the very basic information for be able to use the repository.

## Requirements

The repository must contain the following files with appropriate content:

- `License.txt`
- `.gitignore`
- `ReadMe.md`

The `ReadMe.md`-file must contain all relevant information and explanations to be able to use the content of the repository.

A further explanation in the `ReadMe.md`-file about the implemented repository-structure and the applied branching-system is recommended if available.

### Versions

All finished milestones/versions must be git-tagged.
The versioning scheme for tags of commits must be `v{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}`.
